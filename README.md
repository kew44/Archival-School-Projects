Projects from VERY early days-potentially to re-vamp to learn new languages

Since this repository is akin to putting my "baby pictures" online, here's an actual picture of me at a computer as a toddler:

But, in the words of Maya Angelou, "If you don't know where you've come from, you don't know where you're going." There may come a day when I need some nugget of logic or syntax from my earliest days as a programmer to help solve a problem. I could brush off some of these old files to try a new approach or transcode to learn a new language. Or, this repository could serve as a humorous reminder of how far my skills have come. Most likely, though, it will never be used.
